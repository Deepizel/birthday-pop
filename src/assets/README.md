# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following images for the birthday page:

1. `adunni-image1.jpg` - Image of My Dearest Adunni
2. `adunni-image2.jpg` - Image of My Beautiful Adunni  
3. `adunni-image3.jpg` - Image of My Beloved Adunni

To add your own images:
1. Replace the placeholder images with actual photos of Adunni
2. Update the image paths in the birthday component HTML if needed
3. Make sure images are optimized for web (recommended size: 300x200px)

For music:
- Add an MP3 file named `birthday-music.mp3` for background music
- The component will automatically play it on load
