          From the very beginning, you have been my anchor through life's storms and my sunshine through the brightest days. You've stood with me through the highs and the lows, never once wavering, never once giving up on me. Your patience, your understanding, and your quiet strength have carried me in ways words can hardly describe. 💖

          I look at our two wonderful boys, and I see your heart in them. I see the love, the sacrifice, the prayers, and the endless care you pour into raising them. You are not just a mother; you are a nurturer, a guide, and a living example of what love and devotion should look like. 💖

          For me, you have been everything. You are my biggest cheerleader, the one who believes in me even when I struggle to believe in myself. You remind me of my strength when I feel weak, and you constantly push me to reach higher, to dream bigger, and to never give up. 💖
